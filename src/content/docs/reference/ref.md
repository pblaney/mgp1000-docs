## Reference Genome
For this initial version of the MGP1000, the reference genome that will be used is GRCh38 (i.e. hg38).
All modules of the pipeline are currently only designed to utilize this version. Newer version may eventually be considered if tool-specific reference files can be regenerated upon it.
All reference files are provided with the repository and are stored within the `references/hg38` directory.

The core reference file `Homo_sapiens_assembly38.fasta` was sourced from the Broad Institute's publicly available hg38 reference [resource](https://console.cloud.google.com/storage/browser/genomics-public-data/resources/broad/hg38/v0).
This build includes all autosomes, both sex chromosomes, mitochondrial DNA contig, EBV DNA contig, all random/unplaced/alt/decoy contigs, and all HLA contigs.
